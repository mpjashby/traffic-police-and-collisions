# Load data and create new variables for analysis

All of the data imported into this file are counts (of officers, FPNs etc.). For
the analysis, some variables need to be converted to different formats:

  * traffic officers should be expressed as a proportion of all officers, and
  * FPNs and breath tests should be expressed per officer.
  
This will allow these variables to be included in models along with the number
of officers in each force.

```{r}
data <- read_csv("../analysis_data/traffic_police_and_collisions.csv") %>% 
  mutate(
    roads_officers_prop = roads_officers / officers,
    fpn_all_rate = fpn_all / officers,
    fpn_phone_rate = fpn_phone / officers,
    fpn_speed_rate = fpn_speed / officers,
    breath_test_rate = breath_tests  /officers
  )
```


# Collisions vs officers

```{r}

```
