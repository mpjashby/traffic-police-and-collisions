# Data sources

The data used in this study are from:

  * **collisions data** from [Road Accident and Safety Statistics Table RAS50016](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/ras50-contributory-factors)
  * **police workforce data** and **police functions data** from [Police workforce England and Wales statistics](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/police-workforce-england-and-wales)
  * **vehicle kilometres data** from [Road Traffic Statistics Table TRA8904](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/tra89-traffic-by-local-authority) 

# Pre-processing

Since the government typically does not provide data tables in machine-readable 
formats, the files have been lightly pre-processed before importing into R.
This includes removing footnotes and multiple header rows, as well as separating
multi-worksheet spreadsheets into flat CSV files. All other processing (e.g.
wide-to-long conversion) is done in this file.
