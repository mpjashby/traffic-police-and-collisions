This is a study of relationships between road traffic collisions and the number 
and activities of traffic police.

# Introduction

The objective of this study is to look at the relationships between the 
frequency of RTCs in England and Wales and:

  * the number of police officers,
  * the proportion of those officers allocated primarily to traffic duties, and
  * the traffic-related enforcement carried out by those officers, particularly 
    'fatal four' enforcement.

To do that it will be necessary to control for:

  * exposure to accident potential, in the form of vehicle kilometres, and
  * police force (as a proxy for force-level and force-area variance).

# Project structure

The file structure of the project loosely follows the [Tier Protocol](https://www.projecttier.org/tier-protocol/specifications/). Guidance
on using Git for version control comes from [Vuorre and Curley (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1177/2515245918754826).

The code is split into separate files according to function:

  1. Data cleaning and formating
  2. Data analysis
  3. Outputs
  4. Functions
